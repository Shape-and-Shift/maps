# Maps

A beautifully simple, yet deceptively powerful, Map element with Mapbox support.

Configure the map element within your shopping experience.

### Mapbox API Key
In order to use our Maps element you'll need an API key from Mapbox.
Mapbox is free up to 50.000 Requests per month.

First register on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
You can get your API key if you go to your [Access tokens](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) page within your account.

Copy your **public token** and paste this token to your **Mapbox API Key** configuration within your Shopware plugin settings page.
Now you can use your maps element within your shopping experience.
